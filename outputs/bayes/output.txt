The Naive Bayes model demonstrates strong performance in spam email detection, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.49% on the test set (split ratio: 50%). 
The classification report reveals balanced precision and recall scores for both classes as well as a high F1-score indicating robustness in handling false positives and negatives. 
The near-identical macro and weighted averages (0.98â€“0.99) further confirm consistent performance across classes, suggesting Naive Bayes is well-suited for this binary classification task despite its simplicity. 
Potential limitations (e.g., skewed datasets or feature dependencies) should be investigated in future work.
